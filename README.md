**ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Leonard, an 19-year-old software engineer who loves to create open-source projects & explore new technologies.**

## ðŸ’» What I'm currently working on
I'm currently working on [0analytics](https://github.com/0analytics), a service that optimizes your website based on its analytics.
Alongside 0analytics, I'm building [Base](https://github.com/l2ig/base), a conceptual framework for easier server- & client-side communication. I'd love to hear your feedback on it!
